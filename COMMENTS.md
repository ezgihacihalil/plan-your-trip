Please answer these questions once you have finished the assignment.

**What did you think of the assignment?**

_I found the assignment to be quite engaging and challenging. It was a good mix of tasks that tested both my problem-solving skills and my knowledge of React and TypeScript and also CSS._

**Which part did you consider the most difficult, or did you spend most of your time on?**

_The most time-consuming aspect was the development of the SearchResults component. Additionally, optimizing the components for efficient re-rendering and managing various states (loading, error, and success) posed a significant challenge.._

**Which parts were you not able to fully implement?**

_All the required features were successfully implemented. However, there's room for enhancement in the error handling mechanism to provide more detailed and specific error messages._

**What would you add or improve if you had more time?**

_With additional time, I would focus on expanding the test coverage and setting up the e2e tests for the components to ensure robust functionality. I would also enhance the user interface with transitions and animations, implement styled loading and error states, and introduce code splitting with suspense and lazy loading. And also I would spend more time on image optimizations, and adding edge cases eg. placeholders for missing images._

**What would you do differently if it was a bigger application?**

_For a larger-scale application, I would leverage a state management library like Redux or MobX, or consider using Redux-toolkit or RTK Query for efficient handling of numerous requests and complex data management, including error and loading states for each request. I would also modularize the project structure to maintain an organized and manageable codebase. This could involve moving constants to .env files, creating additional helper functions, and improving their placement, among other things._
